#Accessing GlobalAppData
GlobalAppData is implemented as a singleton and allows access to regularly needed data on all pages so as
to effectively communicate with the API. To access the GlobalAppData object create an instance of it by
calling its initialization method
````swift
let appData = GlobalAppData.getGlobalAppData();
````
Then you can access its content with the appropriate method call.
To get the user token call:
````swift
let token:String = appData.getUserToken();
````
To get the user type call:
````swift
let usertype:String = appData.getUserType();
````
To get the username call:
````swift
let username:String = appData.getUserName();
````
To get userid call:
````swift
let userid:String = appData.getUserId();
````
To clear all data and reset values to nil call:
````swift
appData.clearGlobalAppData();
````
